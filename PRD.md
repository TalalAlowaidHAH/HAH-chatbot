# Chatbot for Internal Microsoft Email Control – PRD

### TL;DR

Internal employees face chronic email overload, leading to wasted time
and reduced focus. This PRD proposes a web-based chatbot, integrated

## Narrative

Ahmed is a mid-level operations manager. Each morning, his inbox is
flooded with over 100 emails—many irrelevant, some critical. Ahmed
dreads the daily slog of sorting, reading, and prioritizing messages,
knowing that every minute spent on email is a minute not spent on his
team or projects.

One day, Ahmed logs in to the new web-based chatbot built for the
company’s Microsoft email. After signing in, he’s greeted by his name
and a simple prompt: “How can I help with your email today?”

He types, “Summarize my last 20 emails.” Within seconds, the chatbot
returns concise bullet points: team updates, project deadlines, client
issues, celebrating wins—and crucially, flags emails from his director.
Ahmed drills in to read the full content of a key message and
immediately replies to confirm an action item, all without leaving the
chat interface. When his team needs a fast response, he dictates a quick
reply that’s sent securely from his company account.

The outcome is profound: Ahmed no longer feels overwhelmed. He’s aware,
responsive, and able to focus on high-value work instead of
administrative triage. For the company, this shift saves countless
hours, increases satisfaction, and sets a new standard for digital
productivity.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- OAuth 2.0 authentication integrated with Microsoft identity provider

- API calls for email handling using Microsoft Graph API

- Natural-language processing and summarization services

- Web-based, reactive chat UI component

- Lightweight backend service for request brokering and audit logging

### Integration Points

- Microsoft 365 (Outlook), company Active Directory for user
  authentication and authorization

- Internal IT systems for signup/provisioning

### Data Storage & Privacy

- No persistent storage of email content beyond in-memory session; logs
  limited to anonymized diagnostic and usage data

- Compliant with company infosec and data privacy policies

- All data encryption and access controlled per company guidelines

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed to comfortably support all internal employees (estimate: up
  to several thousand concurrent users)

- Low-latency responses for chat and email operations

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring secure authentication and permissions: strictly blocking
  non-company accounts

- Maintaining clarity with users about data boundaries—never storing
  personal or sensitive content beyond what’s needed for operation

- Handling Microsoft API limits and evolving email schema

- Proactive error handling for permission issues or network failures

------------------------------------------------------------------------
